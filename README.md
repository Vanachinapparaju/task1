cleaned data summary-customer personality dataset
The original dataset was unstructured, with all data in a single column. I used Data > Text to Columns to split it into proper columns based on delimiters.

Used filters to identify and fix misplaced data, ensuring all values were aligned to their correct columns.

Checked for missing values in each column using filters.

Confirmed that there were no duplicate records in the dataset.

Removed all zero values where they were not meaningful or relevant.

Applied standard formatting for both text and numerical columns.

Converted the Dt_Customer column to a consistent dd-mm-yyyy date format.

Renamed all column headers to follow a clean and uniform style using lowercase letters and underscores.

Adjusted data alignment to center for better readability.

Verified and corrected data types for numerical and date columns.
